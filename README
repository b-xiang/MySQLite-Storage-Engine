Hi!

This is an skeleton engine, it does not do much. Its been put together for
documentation reasons and as a way to get someone started quickly.

To install, grab a copy of the mysql source code and run this:
./configure --with-mysql=/home/brian/mysql-5.1/ --libdir=/usr/local/lib/mysql/
make install

And then inside of MySQL:

mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN skeleton SONAME 'libskeleton_engine.so';

mysql> CREATE TABLE `d` (`a` varchar(125), b text, primary key(a)) ENGINE=skeleton DEFAULT
CHARSET=latin1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

You will probably need to edit the Makefile.am in the src/ tree if you want
to build on anything other then Linux (and the Makefile assumes that the
server was not compiled for debug).

For Solaris you can enable DTrace probes by adding to configure
--enable-dtrace

Have fun!

Cheers,
  -Brian
