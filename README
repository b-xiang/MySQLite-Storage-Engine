Hi!

This is yet another skeleton engine, it does not do much. Its been put together for
documentation reasons and as a way to get someone started quickly.

Yet another skeleton engine is composed by:
- Skeleton engine v0.7
- EXAMPLE storage engine of MySQL 5.6

To install, grab a copy of the mysql source code and run this:
./configure --with-mysql=$HOME/src/mysql-5.6.10/ --libdir=/usr/local/mysql/
make
make install

And then inside of MySQL:

mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN YA_SKELETON SONAME 'libskeleton_engine.so';

mysql> CREATE TABLE t (a int) ENGINE=ya_skeleton;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.11 sec)

You will probably need to edit the Makefile.am in the src/ tree if you want
to build on anything other then Linux (and the Makefile assumes that the
server was not compiled for debug).

For Solaris you can enable DTrace probes by adding to configure
--enable-dtrace

Have fun!

Cheers,
